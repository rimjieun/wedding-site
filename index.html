      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p class="center">
          <span class="first-letter">J</span>eremy and Naeun met in 2014 while swiping through a reputable dating app called Tinder. They had their first date at The Well in Hollywood, where they got into a heated debate over whether people would be more likely to be able to name four Beatles (Naeun) or four NFL quarterbacks (Jeremy). After polling various bystanders who lived in Hollywood and apparently did not watch football, Naeun won by a large margin (Jeremy disputes this characterization). As a reward, Jeremy paid for four of her vodka sodas. It was Naeun's first Tinder date ever, and Jeremy's last Tinder date ever.
          <br>
          <br> Jeremy and Naeun soon discovered they would probably never have met had it not been for online dating. He was an introverted personal trainer who liked to relieve stress at the gym; she was an extroverted lawyer who liked to relieve stress at bars. On a night out, he liked to leave the bar by 10 p.m.; the earliest she liked to arrive was at 10:30 p.m. Jeremy believes that if you are early, you are on time, and if you are on time, you are late; Naeun believes being early is incredibly rude. But somehow, inexplicably, it all ended up making total sense, kinda like a salted caramel. Because sometimes, the right person isn't the one who is just like you--the right person is the one who helps make you better. When you meet that person, you should probably marry them. So that's what Jeremy and Naeun decided to do, and that's why you're here.
          <br>
          <br> Thanks for visiting our website!
          <br>
          <br>

        <p>
          For those coming in from out of town, please see below a list of hotels that are closest to our wedding venue. We also recommend you consider renting accommodations from <a href="https://www.vrbo.com" target="_blank">VRBO</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>. Because so many of our guests have expressed interest in attractions all across the city, we have elected not to do a room block and encourage you to stay in the location most convenient for your plans.
          <br>
          <br> Naeun and Jeremy, along with several members of the bridal party, will be staying at the <a href="http://www.thesurfridermalibu.com" target="_blank">Surfrider Malibu Inn</a>, a small hotel off the coast of Malibu that is about a 20-minute drive to the wedding venue. If you are interested in staying at the Surfrider, we strongly suggest you make reservations as soon as possible, as it is one of the newest and most popular beach-side hotels and sells out very quickly.

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
          After considering eloping in far-off, exotic locations, we realized that we wanted nothing more than to tie the knot in the city that brought us together: Los Angeles. For those visiting Los Angeles for the first time, we are so excited to welcome you to our adopted home. Below is a list of some of our favorite LA attractions, listed from west to east. No matter where you go, expect traffic and difficult parking conditions. We strongly recommend you use ride-sharing services to avoid road rage and frustration. We hope you love our city as much as we do!

                The Santa Monica Pier is at the intersection of Colorado Avenue and the Pacific Ocean. Stop by for beautiful views of the ocean and great beachside restaurants. Make a full day of it at the small amusement park on the southside of the pier, or rent bikes and head down the beach bike path.
